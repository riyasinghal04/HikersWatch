# HikersWatch
ANDROID STUDIO PROJECT<br><br>
In this app, I made use of the GOOGLE MAPS API to enable the feature of the maps and geolocation.
<br>
With the help of the API , we are able to identify the users location( a hiker on his hike!) and provide details such as the latitude , longitude, altitude , bearing , address of the users exact loaction.
